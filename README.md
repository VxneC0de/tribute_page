# Tribute Page of Mack Zuckerberg

> This page is based on a Free Code Camp project about responsive web design, specifically the survey form project. I decided to make my tribute page about Mack Zuckerberg, with a brief timeline explaining his beginnings to what he has achieved today. Also, being a Free Code Camp project, the methods, tags, properties, among others, required to finish the page were used.
